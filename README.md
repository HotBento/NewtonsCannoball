Game Description:
Experience the fascinating laws of gravity in this physics-based 2D game. Multiple planets with unique gravitational pulls are randomly placed on the screen. Your goal is to launch a cannonball from one planet and use the gravitational forces of all planets to curve its path and hit a target located on another planet.

How to Play:

Mouse Controls:
Click and drag near the player to aim the cannonball’s angle and set the launch power. Release the mouse button to fire.

Keyboard Controls:

Arrow Keys (↑ ↓ ← →): Fine-tune the cannonball’s angle and power.

Shift Key: Hold Shift for more precise, smaller adjustments.

Spacebar: Quickly fire the cannonball without dragging.

R Key: Reset the game to start a new round.

Objective:
Use your understanding of gravity and trajectory to accurately aim and launch the cannonball so that it curves through the gravitational fields and hits the target on another planet. After hitting the target, you’ll receive a success message and the game will reset for another challenge.
